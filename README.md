# opensand-docker

**opensand-docker is a container-based tool that allows deploying an emulated satellite architecture into Docker containers.**

As the name of the projet suggests, it uses OpenSAND, an open source emulator developped by CNES (National Centre for Space Studies), Thales Alenia Space and Viv√©ris Technologies companies. For more informations, https://opensand.org/content/home.php

Here are the requirements for using the tool locally :

        ubuntu 16.04 xenial OS (if not, use a xenial ubuntu VM to launch the manager)
        docker packages (please refer to the official documentation https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
        opensand-manager (please refer to the official documentation for installing opensand-manager https://opensand.org/content/get.php)
        Make sure 192.168.{1..9}y.0/24 addresses are free on your workstation. Those adresses will be used by Docker for the emulation.
        First launching could be a little long (a few minutes) as you need to build opensand images.
        Using the sudo rights
        
Here are some commands to deploy the architecture :

**Print the help :**

    ./opensand-docker -h 
  
 **Deploy a simple architecture.** Note that it indirectly create opensand docker images and networks, recquired for the deployment.
 The simple architecture includes a collector, a satellite, a satellite terminal and a client in each local network in each terrestrial entity (GW and ST)
  
    ./opensand-docker --simulate
  
**Deploy a more detailed architecture**, here with 1 gateway, 3 satellite terminals and 2 clients in each local network
  
    ./opensand-docker --simulate -i 2 -gw 1 -st 3 -c 2 
  
**More generally :**

    ./opensand-docker --simulate -i $simulation_id -gw $nb_gw -st $nb_st -c $nb_clients
    
  Note that you cannot deploy :
  
    - more than 2 gateways
  
    - more than 5 satellite terminals
    
    - the "simulation_id" must be between 0 and 9 included and define ip adresses of the architecture.  
    
OpenSAND offers the possibility to deploy a "split-gateway" : a gateway for physical aspect and a related gateway for network access (For more details : https://wiki.net4sat.org/doku.php?id=opensand:emulated_satcom_features:system:split_gateway:index). **To Deploy a split gateway, just replace -gw by -sgw (you can still deploy until 2 split gateways)**

**Use sand-manager GUI to start a simulation**

        sand-manager -i
        
 The orchestrator automatically launch sand-manager but there could be some problems with the GUI part. In case of problem, remove the GUI, kill the sand-manager (pkill sand-manager) process and re-try the sand-manager -i command.

**While simulation running, you can modify some parameters by**
        
        - using the GUI interface (the simulation must be previously stopped)
        OR
        - using the following command : ./opensand-docker --simulation-change -id ${simulation_id} -d 150 -fbw 100
        This command will set the delay to 150ms (by default 125ms) and the forward bandwidth to 100MHz (by default 50MHz)
        
**Current simulation OpenSAND entities are listed with the following command :**
         
         ./opensand-docker --list-simulation

**Running containers are listed with :**

        docker ps 
        
**Access to a running client with following command**
 
        docker exec -it ws-$LAN_GW-$client_id-$simulation_id (use docker ps command to know exactly the name of your clients containers)
        
Note that default route is configured as its associated LAN_GW.


  **Remove the architecture with simulation id equal to $simulation_id** (i correspond to the id of the simulation, by default 0 if not precised) : 
 
    ./opensand-docker --destroy -i $simulation_id
    
 **A recommended practice is to exit the manager GUI after deleting the architecture**
