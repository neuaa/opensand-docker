# opensand-docker

This file explains how to use the project opensand-docker.

**opensand-docker is a container-based tool that allows deploying an emulated satellite architecture into Docker containers.**

As the name of the projet suggests, it uses OpenSAND, an open source emulator developped by CNES (National Centre for Space Studies), Thales Alenia Space and Viv√©ris Technologies companies. For more informations, https://opensand.org/content/home.php

Here are some commands to deploy the architecture :

**Print the help :**

./opensand-docker -h 
  
 **Deploy a simple architecture.** Note that it indirectly create opensand docker images and networks, recquired for the deployment.
 The simple architecture includes a collector, a satellite, a satellite terminal and a client in each local network in each terrestrial entity (GW and ST)
  
./opensand-docker --simulate
  
**Deploy a more detailed architecture**, here with 1 gateway, 3 satellite terminals and 2 clients in each local network
  
./opensand-docker -i 2 -gw 1 -st 3 -c 2 
  
**More generally :**

./opensand-docker -i $simulation_id -gw $nb_gw -st $nb_st -c $nb_clients
    
  Note that you cannot deploy :
  
    - more than 2 gateways
  
    - more than 5 satellite terminals
    
    - the "simulation_id" must be between 0 and 9 included and define ip adresses of the architecture.   
  
  
**Remove the architecture with simulation id equal to 0** (i correspond to the id of the simulation, by default 0) : 
 
 ./opensand-docker --destroy -i 0
